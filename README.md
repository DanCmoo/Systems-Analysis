# System Analysis
This repository contains all the projects from the systems analysis and design course in Universidad Distrital Francisco José de Caldas in the 2025-1 semester.
## 📁 Main Folders

- [Workshop 1](./Workshop_1)
  Contains the report and resources for the "Backpack Price Prediction" project. It develops a solution to predict backpack prices using systemic analysis and machine learning, based on a Kaggle dataset. The folder includes data analysis, modeling (linear and multiple regression), model evaluation, and conclusions about the factors influencing price.
- [Workshop 2](./Workshop_2_Design)
  Contains the system design and implementation for a backpack price prediction model, building upon the work from Workshop_1. It focuses on system architecture, includes XGBoost models, sensitivity analysis, chaos theory for outlier detection, and automated retraining mechanisms.
- [Workshop 3 ](./Workshop_3)
- [Workshop 3 Simulation](./Workshop_3_Simulation)
  Contains the code for the third workshop. This folder holds the simulation-related implementation and scripts developed as part of the Systems Analysis and Design course.
