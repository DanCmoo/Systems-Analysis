# System Analysis
This repository contains all the projects from the systems analysis and design course in Universidad Distrital Francisco Jos√© de Caldas in the 2025-1 semester.

## üìÅ Main Folders

- [Workshop 1](./Workshop_1)  
  Contains the report and resources for the "Backpack Price Prediction" project. It develops a solution to predict backpack prices using systemic analysis and machine learning, based on a Kaggle dataset. The folder includes data analysis, modeling (linear and multiple regression), model evaluation, and conclusions about the factors influencing price.

- [Workshop 2](./Workshop_2_Design)  
  Contains the system design and implementation for a backpack price prediction model, building upon the work from Workshop_1. It focuses on system architecture, includes XGBoost models, sensitivity analysis, chaos theory for outlier detection, and automated retraining mechanisms.

- [Workshop 3](./Workshop_3)  
  Contains the computational simulation of the backpack price prediction system, validating the architecture from Workshop 2. Includes XGBoost model comparisons (with/without material feature), chaos theory integration through ¬±10% perturbations, Isolation Forest outlier detection (1% contamination), and automated data pipelines. Key results show Model A (with material) achieved RMSE=38.72 vs Model B's 39.50.

- [Workshop 3 Simulation](./Workshop_3_Simulation)  
  Contains the simulation-specific implementation scripts and Jupyter notebooks used for chaotic behavior analysis, including Partial Dependence Plots and sensitivity testing on weight_capacity, size_Large, and compartments features.
