# Backpack Price Prediction System - System Design

## Project Overview
This repository contains the system design and implementation for a machine learning model to predict backpack prices, building upon the analysis from [Workshop #1](#workshop-1-analysis). The system addresses sensitivity and chaotic behavior in pricing patterns through robust architectural design.

## Key Features
- Dual XGBoost models (with/without material feature)
- Chaos theory implementation for outlier detection
- Sensitivity analysis through partial dependence plots
- Automated retraining mechanism

## Development Process
### Phase 1: Analysis (Workshop #1)
[Refer to PDF report](#final-report) for detailed findings from initial analysis that informed this design:
- Identified key price determinants: brand, material, size, compartments
- Detected high sensitivity to weight capacity and material changes
- Observed chaotic pricing patterns in similar backpacks

### Phase 2: System Architecture

*Data flow and component interaction (see [section 3](#) in PDF report)*

Key design decisions influenced by chaos theory:
- Isolation Forest for non-parametric outlier detection (±3σ thresholds)
- Observer pattern for automatic model retraining
- Uncertainty ranges instead of fixed price predictions

### Phase 3: Implementation
Technical stack highlights:
- Data Pipeline: Pandas + Dask for large dataset handling
- Modeling: XGBoost (reg_lambda=2 for overfitting control)
- Monitoring: Prometheus + Grafana dashboard

## Final Deliverables
1. [Final Report PDF](./reports/workshop2_final_report.pdf) - Complete system documentation
2. [Jupyter Notebooks](./notebooks/) - Analysis and model development
3. [API Implementation](./src/) - Flask/FastAPI deployment code

## How Chaos Theory Informed Design
1. **Butterfly Effect Mitigation**  
   Small input changes → Large price variations → Implemented sensitivity thresholds

2. **Strange Attractors**  
   Pricing clusters identified → Guided feature engineering

3. **Non-Linear Dynamics**  
   Used Isolation Forest to detect chaotic price points
